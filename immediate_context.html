<h1 style="text-align: center;"><q>Deep</q> and <q>shallow</q> ill-formedness</h1>

This paper proposes no changes to the language (or the Standard Library). It only offers a wording that clarifies a couple of  things:
<ol>
<li>How deleted functions are treated in SFINAE contexts.</li>
<li>What constitutes the "immediate context" during template argument substitution.</li>
<li>When can a template be instantiated during the substitution.</li>
</ol>

Additionally, it provides a brief and formal term "superficially well-formed" as a replacement for long
repetitive and non-normative explanations in Clause 20.13, like 

<blockquote>"Access checking
is performed as if in a
context unrelated to <code>T</code> and
<code>U</code>. Only the validity of the
immediate context of the
assignment expression is
considered. [<i>Note:</i> The
compilation of the
expression can result in
side effects such as the
instantiation of class
template specializations
and function template
specializations, the
generation of
implicitly-defined
functions, and so on. Such
side effects are not in the
&ldquo;immediate context&rdquo; and
can result in the program
being ill-formed. <i>&mdash; end
note</i>]" </blockquote>

<p>This addresses issues <a href="http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-active.html#2290">2290</a> and <a href="http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-active.html#2496">2496</a>.</p> 


<h2>Remaining issues</h2>

<p>Currently the definition of <em>superficially well-formed expression</em> is located in 20.13 [meta] (library section).
It should be moved to the language section, so that SFINAE based on expressions can also make use of it.
Perhaps it should be located in section clause Expressions.</p>

<p>Perhaps we need to define a subset of ill-formed conditions as "type-system failues" and say that only type-system
failues in overload resolution and superficial well-formedness get turned into compile-time predicates. 
It is confusing to see "if X happens program is ill-formed; if program is ill-formed,
it is fine and we return <code>true</code> and it is back well formed.</p>

<p>This proposal does not address the issue of whether it is allowed for the implementations to "short-circuit" 
the overload resolution process and skip instantiating some template specializations when they can prove by other means
that these specializations would be a worse match that other candidates seen so far.</p>

<p>This proposal also does not specify what happens when we get an error while instantiating a variable template
specialization. We leave it (at least for now) to the implementers. We note that solving this problem is not essential for providing a useful contract between programmers
and compiler vendors in the form of type traits, and SFINAE in general.</p>

<p>Some tricky constructs using alias templates have not been addressed in this proposal.</p>

<h2>Proposed wording</h2>

<p>(Relative to N4582.)</p>

</ul>

</ins>
<del>If a substitution results in an invalid type or expression, type deduction fails.</del> An invalid type or expression is
one that would be ill-formed, with a diagnostic required, if written using the substituted arguments. [<i>Note</i>:
If no diagnostic is required, the program is still ill-formed. <del>Access checking is done as part of the substitution
process.</del> &mdash; <i>end note</i>] <del>Only invalid types and expressions in the immediate context of the function type and

and/or function template specializations, the generation of implicitly-defined functions, etc. Such side effects
are not in the immediate context and can result in the program being ill-formed. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</del>

<ins>If a substitution results in an invalid type or expression in a remote context, the program is ill-formed. 
If a substitution results in an invalid type or expression in a non-remote context, type deduction fails.

<li><p>In 8.4.3 [dcl.fct.def.delete] change paragraph 2 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>A program that refers to a deleted function implicitly or explicitly, other than to declare it, is ill-formed.
[<i>Note:</i> This includes calling the function implicitly or explicitly and forming a pointer or pointer-to-member
to the function. It applies even for references in expressions that are not potentially-evaluated. If a function
is overloaded, it is referenced only if the function is selected by overload resolution. The implicit odr-use (3.2)
of a virtual function does not, by itself, constitute a reference. <i>&mdash;end note</i>]
<ins>[<i>Note:</i> Making a program ill-formed while determining if a program construct is superficially well-formed (20.13)
has special meaning and may not in fact result in the program being ill-formed. <i>&mdash;end note</i>]</ins></blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Insert somewere at the beginning of 20.13 [meta] the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A number of traits in this clause need to determine if a given program construct <code>P</code> is well-formed for a number of types <code>Tn</code>.</p>

<p>A type or an expression <code>X</code> is said to be in the <em>immediate context</em> of a program construct <code>P</code> when in the process of determination of well-formedness of <code>P</code> none of the following is the case:
<ul>
<li>a class template specialization is instantiated and <code>X</code> is a member or a base class thereof, or</li>
<li>a function template specialization is instantiated and <code>X</code> occurs in the definition thereof, or</li>
<li>an implicitly-defined non-deleted function is generated and <code>X</code> occurs in the definition thereof.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>It is unspecified whether an invalid language construct formed while instantiating a variable template (14.5.3)
specialization, for the purpose of determining a well-formedness of an expression <code>P</code>,
is in the immediate context of <code>P</code>.</p>

<p>The process of determining the well-formedness of a program construct <code>P</code> may instantiate
a class template specialization if and only if this specialization must be used to determine the validity
of a type or subexpression of <code>P</code>, in a way that requires the class type to be complete (3.2).
Similarly, the process of determining the well-formedness of a program construct <code>P</code> may instantiate
a function template specialization if and only if it needs to deduce the function's return type from its
definition (7.1.6.4).</p>

<p>A type or an expression <code>X</code> is said to be <em>invalid</em> if forming it, during the instantiation
of a program construct <code>P</code> with arguments <code>Tn</code>, would make the program ill-formed,
with a diagnostic required. Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to any of types <code>Tn</code>.</p>

<p>A program construct <code>P</code> is <em>deeply ill-formed</em> for types <code>Tn</code> when instantiaing <code>P</code>
with arguments <code>Tn</code> would cause any subexpression or type <code>X</code> in the non-immediate context of
<code>P</code> to be invalid, or if it would resut in exceeding one of the implementation-defined limits.
A program construct <code>P</code> is <em>deeply well-formed</em> when it is not deeply ill-formed.</p>

<p>A program construct <code>P</code> is <em>superficially ill-formed</em> for types <code>Tn</code> when it is deeply well-formed for <code>Tn</code> and when instantiaing <code>P</code> with arguments <code>Tn</code> would cause any subexpression or type <code>X</code> in the immediate context of <code>P</code> to be invalid. A program construct <code>P</code> is <em>superficially well-formed</em> for types <code>Tn</code> when it is deeply well-formed for <code>Tn</code>, and it is not superficially ill-formed for <code>Tn</code>. Determining that an expression is superficially ill-formed does not make the program ill-formed. [<i>Note:</i> An expression may be determined to be superficially well-formed and yet its odr-use may cause a program to be ill-formed. </i>&mdash; end note</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>Example:</i> Given the following definitions:<pre>
  template &lt;class T&gt; struct S {
    using type = T[2];
  };

  template &lt;class T, class U = void, class V = typename S&lt;U&gt;::type&gt;
    auto f(T) -&gt; V&amp;;

  template &lt;class T, class U = void, class V = U[2]&gt;
    auto g(T) -&gt; V&amp;;

  template &lt;class T&gt; 
    void h(T) { static_assert(sizeof(T) == 0); }
</pre>
Expression <code>f(1)</code> is deeply ill-formed because an invalid type 'array of type <code>void</code>' is formed while instantiating the body of a class template specialization, which is a non-immediate context. Expression <code>g(1)</code> is superficially ill-formed because an invalid type 'array of type <code>void</code>' would be formed in an immediate context. Expression <code>h(1)</code> is superficially well-formed because no invalid type or expression would be formed in the process of determining well-formedness.
<i>&mdash; end example</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>Example:</i> Given the following definitions:<pre>
  auto is_even = [](auto v) { return v % 2 == 0; };
  auto is_odd  = [](auto v) -> decltype(v % 2 == 1) { return v % 2 == 1; };
</pre>
Expression <code>is_even(nullptr)</code> is deeply ill-formed because an invalid expression <code>nullptr % 2 == 0</code> is formed while instantiating the body of a function template specialization (for the purpose of determining its return type), which is a non-immediate context. Expression <code>is_odd(nullptr)</code> is superficially ill-formed because an invalid expression <code>nullptr % 2 == 1</code> would be formed in an immediate context.
<i>&mdash; end example</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>Example:</i> Given the following definitions:
<pre>  template &lt;class T&gt; struct X {};
  
  template &lt;typename T>
    using XT = typename X&lt;T&gt;::type;
</pre>
Type <code>XT&lt;int&gt;</code> is superficially ill-formed because an invalid type <code>X&lt;int&gt;::type</code> would be formed inside an alias template, which is an immediate context.
<i>&mdash; end example</i>]</p>

<p>[<i>Example:</i> Given the following definition:
<pre>  struct S {
    C(int);
    C(double) = delete;
  };
</pre>
Expression <code>C(0.5)</code> is superficially ill-formed because the call to a deleted function is in the immediate the context of the expression and it would cause the program to be ill-formed.
<i>&mdash; end example</i>]</p>

<p>Whenever in this clause it is stated that a program construct <code>P</code> is superficially well-formed for types <code>Tn</code>, there is an implied precondition that <code>P</code> is deeply well-formed for <code>Tn</code>. If this precondition is not satisfied, the program is ill-formed.</p>
