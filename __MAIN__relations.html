<h2>3.2. Mathematical soundness</h2>

<p>In this section we respond to the claim that the requirement on <code>CommonReference</code> is <em>required</em>
   to make concept <code>StrictWeakOrdering</code> "mathematically sound".
   </p>
   
<p>The notion of being "mathematically sound" has no formal definition and is subject to personal judgement or aesthetic
   preference. In order to facilitate the discussion we would need to define it. One possible attempt is the following. 
   Because in mathematics, the concept of <em>strict weak ordering</em> is described for elements <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>,
   <em>c</em> from one domain <em>D</em>, one could express the corresponding requirements in C++ for objects <code>a</code>,
   <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> of the same type <code>D</code>. This choice is far from obvious. A domain in the mathematical
   sense can comprise values represented by C++ objects of two or more different types. A mathematical domain is not constrained
   by the C++ type-system. But if this path is nonetheless chosen, one has to oblidge the user to provide a number of additional
   definitions (however difficult, impractical or error prone) to create a single type <code>D</code>
   and express the axioms token-by-token as they are spelled out in mathematics for objects of type <code>D</code>.
   </p>
   
<p>We do not propose this, and instead offer the following alternative. Provide a formal system based on the mathematical
   concept of <em>strict weak ordering</em> that preserves its essential properties and gives us the benefits of the
   mathematical concept, but works for two types <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> without requiring a common type and
   corresponding conversions.
   </p>
   
<p>What we require of the syntactic and semantic constraints on concepts:
   </p>
   
   <ul><li>That they are sufficient to describe preconditions and postconditions on functions dealing with order.
           </li>
       <li>That they are sufficient for the run-time injected diagnostic code (such as inside <code>assert()</code>) to be able
           to test if all the semantic constraints were met.
           </li>
      </ul>

<p>The essential axioms of <em>weak ordering</em> over a given domain <var>D</var> are:
   </p>

   <ul>
     <li><em>irreflexivity</em>: for all <var>a</var> in <var>D</var>: <var>!r(a, a)</var>,</li>
     <li><em>asymmetry</em>: for all <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> in <var>D</var>: <var>r(a, b)</var> &Implies; <var>&not;r(b, a)</var>,</li>
     <li><em>transitivity</em>: for all <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var> in <var>D</var>: <var>r(a, b) &and; r(b, c)</var> &Implies; <var>r(a, c)</var>,</li>
     <li><em>transitivity of equivalence</em>: for all <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var> in <var>D</var>: 
         <var>(&not;r(a, b) &and; &not;r(b, a)) &and; (&not;r(b, c) &and; &not;r(c, b))</var> &Implies; <var>(&not;r(a, c) &and; &not;r(c, a))</var>.</li>
   </ul>

<p>Or the equivalent formulation presented in section "4.2 Total and Weak Orderings" of "Elements of Programming" by Alexander Stepanov and Paul McJones:
   </p>
   
   <ul>
     <li><em>transitivity</em>: for all <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var> in <var>D</var>: <var>r(a, b) &and; r(b, c)</var> &Implies; <var>r(a, c)</var>,</li>
     <li><em>weak trichotomy</em>: for all <var>a</var>, <var>b</var> in <var>D</var> exactly one of the three expressions is true: <var>r(a, b)</var>, <var>r(b, a)</var>, (<var>&not;r(a, b) &and; &not;r(b, a)</var>).</li>
   </ul>
      
<p>We believe the following functions are sufficient to express the above requirements:
   </p> 
   
<pre>template &lt;typename A&gt;
bool irreflexivity(const A&amp; a)
{
  return !comp(a, a);
}

template &lt;typename A, typename B&gt;
bool asymmetry(const A&amp; a, const B&amp; b)
{
  if (comp(a, b))
    return !comp(b, a);
  return true;     
}

template &lt;typename A, typename B, typename C&gt;
bool transitivity(const A&amp; a, const B&amp; b, const C&amp; c)
{
  if (comp(a, b))
    if (comp(b, c))
      return comp(a, c);
  return true;     
}

template &lt;typename A, typename B, typename C&gt;
bool transitivity_of_equivalence(const A&amp; a, const B&amp; b, const C&amp; c)
{
  if (!comp(a, b) &amp;&amp; !comp(b, a))
    if (!comp(b, c) &amp;&amp; !comp(c, b))
      return !comp(a, c) &amp;&amp; !comp(c, a);
  return true;     
}

template &lt;typename A, typename B&gt;
bool weak_trichotomy(const A&amp; a, const B&amp; b)
{
  int truths = int(comp(a, b)) + int(comp(b, a)) + int(!comp(a, b) &amp;&amp; !comp(b, a));
  return truths == 1;
}
</pre>   
   
<p>Where each <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> can be either <code>T</code> or <code>U</code>,
   and <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> represent all elements encountered
   while evaluating the STL order-related function.
   These require that the predicate apart from working for <code>comp(t, u)</code> and <code>comp(u, t)</code>
   also needs to work for <code>comp(t, t)</code> and <code>comp(u, u)</code>, but require no existence of
   a common type or conversions to this common type.
