CCS roles/modes
===============

Default
---------
code below *depends* on the condition to be true (UB if violation gets inside).


Audit
-----
same as *Default* but we have reasons to believe that checking it at runtime will noticeably affect program performance.


Axiom
-----
Same as *Default* except that evaluating preconditions at runtime would have correctness impact on the program:
broken preconditions, program would not compile.
